1.	Spatial Distribution of Disease: The study aimed to understand complex patterns of disease occurrence by analysing both space and time. This approach helped identify how cases changed over time and space, revealing the dynamic nature of the disease. Here systematically mapped attacks by year, detailing the geographic distribution down to the district level.
2.	Exploring distribution of disease an annual and monthly basis: To understand disease dynamics, here examined cumulative monthly and yearly attacks, highlighting seasonal patterns. This underscores the need for targeted surveillance and interventions during high-risk periods, crucial for effective disease management. Bar plots visually depict monthly and yearly attack totals.
3.	Hot-Spot identification by spatial statistics (Getis-Ord index): Spatial autocorrelation measures how closely related values of a variable are based on their proximity in space. The Getis-Ord Gi* index identifies "hot areas" with positive correlation and "cold spots" with negative correlation. Positive Z-scores indicate hotspots, while negative Z-scores indicate cold spots.
4.	Geospatial clustering with SaTScan: SaTScan software version 10.1 identified disease clusters using Poisson-based models. It employed moving windows for spatial clusters and dynamic circles for temporal clusters. District-level coordinates were used for clustering. The method considered case counts adjusted for population and used a robust threshold (p≤0.05) for cluster significance. Clusters were identified at the district level, with red dots showing high clusters and blue dots indicating low clusters.
5.	Discerning Risk Factors using Linear Discriminant Analysis: LDA analyzed risk parameters, establishing a linear relationship between them, aiding understanding of their influence. SaTScan identified significant and non-significant space-time clusters, and LDA evaluated risk factors within these regions. Binary responses (0 or 1) indicated clustered or non-clustered regions. LDA in R used a significance level of p ≤ 0.05, identifying environmental factors with p-values ≤ 0.05 as strongly correlated with disease development. 
6.	Predictive risk assessment through machine learning models: The study employs machine learning algorithms to accurately estimate the risk factors associated with the disease, enhancing precision and performance. A total of 11 machine learning models (NB, FDA, RF, SVM, MARS, ADA, GBM, NNET, CT, GLM, GAM) were trained and validated to ascertain the disease risk. To reduce the skewness and biasness towards present cases, pseudo absence was chosen from same environment condition around present cases.
A comprehensive set of 12 evaluation metrics were employed to assess the discriminative capacity of the fitted models. These metrics were utilized to evaluate the accuracy of prediction models based on the presence (1) or absence (0) of data. The average model score was derived by considering models that met the criteria of kappa > 0.60, ROC > 0.70, TSS > 0.70, AUC > 0.7, accuracy > 0.7, error rate < 0.2, precision > 0.8, sensitivity > 0.8, specificity > 0.8, F1 score > 0.8, logistic loss < 0.7 and gini_coefficient >0.8 for further assessment of disease risk. Based on these criteria models were selected and model scores were averaged to obtain the most reliable predictions.
7.	Transmission dynamics: The basic reproductive number (R0) is a key metric in assessing disease transmission. When R0 > 1, there's a higher risk of spread; < 1 indicates lower risk. R0 can be estimated using Attack Rate (AR), Exponential Growth rate (EG), and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods. This study used AR, EG, and ML, employing the R statistical tool for accuracy.
